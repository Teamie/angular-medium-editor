# angular-medium-editor
This is an Angular 4 directive for the [Medium.com inline editor clone](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor) by Davi Ferreira.

## Installing the Directive

Install with [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install --save angular-medium-editor
```

If all goes well, the angular-medium-editor package should import medium-editor from your node_modules.

Finally, import the directive into your project:

```typescript
  import { MediumEditorDirective } from 'angular-medium-editor/medium-editor.directive.ts';
```

And add the directive to your Declarations:

```typescript
  @NgModule({
    ...
    bootstrap: [ AppComponent ],
    declarations: [
      MediumEditorDirective,
      ...
```

## Usage

Use as an element:

```html
  <medium-editor [(editorModel)]="textVar"
      [editorOptions]="{'toolbar': {'buttons': ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3']}}" 
      [editorPlaceholder]="placeholderVar"></medium-editor>
```

You can optionally pass a placeholder value:

```html
  <medium-editor [(editorModel)]="textVar"
      [editorOptions]="{'toolbar': {'buttons': ['bold', 'italic', 'underline', 'h1', 'h2', 'h3']}}" 
      [editorPlaceholder]="placeholderVar"></medium-editor>
```

For more information on which options you can pass with [editorOptions], check MediumEditor's [options documentation](https://github.com/yabwe/medium-editor#mediumeditor-options) for details.
